# Chapter 1
## Definitions
topological structure:
  title: 'Topological structure'
  decl: 'TopologicalSpace'
  comment: 'mathlib doesn't distinguish between topological spaces and topological structures'
  reference: 'Definition 1.1'
topological space:
  title: 'Topological space'
  decl: 'TopologicalSpace'
  reference: 'Definition 1.2'
homeomorphism:
  title: 'Homeomorphism'
  decl: 'Homeomorph'
  comment: 'in mathlib, a homeomorphism is an Equiv(alence) in which the underlying functions are
    continuous'
  reference: 'Definition 1.3'
neighborhood of a point:
  title: 'Neighborhood of a point'
  decl: 'nhds'
  spelling: 'A ∈ 𝓝 x'
  comment: 'In mathlib, neighborhoods of points do not have their own predicate. A set A is a
    neighborhood of a point x if it lies in the neighborhood filter 𝓝 x.'
  reference: 'Definition 1.4'
neighborhood of a set:
  title: 'Neighborhood of a set'
  decl: 'nhdsSet'
  spelling: 'A ∈ 𝓝ˢ B'
  comment: 'In mathlib, neighborhoods of sets do not have their own predicate. A set A is a
    neighborhood of a set B if it lies in the neighborhood-of-sets filter 𝓝ˢ B'
  reference: 'Definition 1.4'
neighborhood filter of a point:
  title: 'Neighborhood filter of a point'
  decl: 'nhds'
  comment: 'In mathlib, the neighborhood filter of a point x is denoted by nhds x, with custom
    notation 𝓝 x'
  comment2: 'In Bourbaki, this is written as \mathfrak{B}(x)'
neighborhood filter of a set:
  title: 'Neighborhood filter of a set'
  decl: 'nhdsSet'
  comment: 'In mathlib, the neighborhood-of-sets filter of a set B is denoted by nhdsSet B,
    with custom notation 𝓝ˢ B'
## Results, how should we handle naming of these?
proposition 1:
  title: 'Proposition 1'
  decl: ''
  statement: 'A set is a neighborhood of all its points iff it is open.'
  reference: 'Proposition 1.1'
